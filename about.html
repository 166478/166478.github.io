    <p>Hello! I’m Zhuo — a first-generation student at UC Irvine majoring in Business Administration with a focus on Marketing.</p>
    <p>What excites me most about marketing is the creativity behind strategy. Whether it's crafting campaigns, understanding brand identity, or making videos that connect with people, I love blending business with storytelling.</p>
    <p>I'm currently exploring the entertainment and beauty industries but open to any space where I can learn and build. Outside of school, I enjoy vlogging, experimenting with digital design, and getting involved in student communities.</p>
    <p>I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow, so feel free to reach out!</p>
