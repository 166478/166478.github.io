    <img src="zhuo-profile.jpg" alt="Zhuo Lee" class="profile-pic" />
    <p>Hello! I am a first-generation student pursuing Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing at UC Irvine. I have a strong interest in the creative aspects of marketing and am eager to explore any creative opportunity out there. I am interested in the entertainment and beauty industries but hope to explore other fields as well.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy crafting videos, particularly vlogs, and I am keen to delve deeper into these skills while integrating them into professional settings. I am actively seeking opportunities for growth and development, so please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
